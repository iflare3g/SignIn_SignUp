Learning Python Flask by real case

Registration-Login system

This small and rookie project is being developed on Cloud9 IDE. HTML Templates are powered by Bootstrap 3. 
The Python version used is the third one.

After installing all modules, by executing run.py, the server goes on. 

It's a simple and basic project used to learn more about Flask microframework and MVC pattern. 

Some part of code are not written in the best pythonic way, but I like Python and I'm studying it to improve my coding skills.

The forgot password is working but it's a test, because that way isn't the right one as if I knew your email, I would change your password and logging into your account.
